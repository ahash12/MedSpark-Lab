# MedSpark Labs ðŸ¥¼
Please bear with me as I embark on the journey of becoming technically apt :)

I believe that AI can have a powerful role in advancing the future of healthcare in two primary ways:
- creating data-backed black box algorithms: where we may not know enough about a disease, we can create 'educated (data-backed) decisions'
- creating third-eyes: explainable AI technologies that help us see microscopic & macroscopic changes in ways we haven't seen

As I experiment with ML, then Deep Learning, and other random tools, I hope to leverage simple tools for scalable impact. 


If you're a fellow medical student, I hope these projects are ones you can adapt as well.
